# Test Prompts v2 - MCP3.0 Comprehensive Testing Guide
## Q-SYS MCP3.0 Server Validation Suite

This document contains comprehensive test prompts for the MCP3.0 reduced toolset (5 tools). Each prompt is designed to be copied and pasted directly into an MCP agent chat for execution.

**IMPORTANT**: Every test session MUST start with connection verification. The agent will check connection status and establish/verify connection before proceeding with tests.

**PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS**: MCP3.0 is designed for ultra-high performance:
- Tool response time: < 10ms overhead
- Connection time: < 1 second
- Memory usage: < 50MB
- Startup time: < 500ms
- All batch operations must be parallel

## CONNECTION SETUP (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

### Test 0.1: Initial Connection Verification and Setup

```
TEST: Connection Verification and Setup

IMPORTANT: If not connected, ASK FOR IP FIRST before showing any test reports.

Please execute the following connection verification steps:

1. Use qsys_status to check current connection
2. If connected:
   - Report Core IP, status, and component count
   - Proceed to next test
3. If disconnected:
   - IMMEDIATELY ask the user (no test report needed yet):
     "No Q-SYS Core connection detected. Please provide the IP address of your Q-SYS Core (e.g., 192.168.1.100):"
   - WAIT for user to provide IP address (just the question, nothing else)
   - Once IP is provided, use qsys_connect with: 
     {host: "[provided IP]", port: 443, secure: true}
   - After connection attempt, use qsys_status to verify
   - THEN provide the complete test report
4. If connection still fails after receiving IP:
   - Check the error message from the connect action
   - Ask: "Cannot reach [IP]. Please verify:
     - Q-SYS Core is powered on at [IP]
     - You can ping [IP] from your network
     Provide different IP or 'skip' to stop:"
   - If new IP provided, return to step 3
   - If 'skip', show brief connection error and stop

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Connection Status: [connected/disconnected]
- Core IP: [IP address if connected]
- Component Count: [number if connected]
- Control Count: [total controls if connected]
- Polling Interval: [ms]
- User Interaction: [IP requested and received]
- Action Taken: [connected/reconnected/failed]

IMPORTANT: Do not proceed with other tests until connection is confirmed.
IMPORTANT: You MUST ask for the IP address interactively - do not guess or use placeholder IPs.
```

### Test 0.2: Component Filtering Feature

```
TEST: Component Filtering During Connection

Test the new component filtering feature that reduces memory usage:

1. First, connect WITHOUT filter to get baseline:
   - Use qsys_connect with host only
   - Note componentsLoaded count from response
   - Use qsys_status to check memory baseline

2. Disconnect and reconnect WITH filter:
   - Use qsys_connect with host and filter: "Gain"
   - Note componentsLoaded count (should be much less)
   - Verify filterApplied: true in response
   - Use qsys_discover to verify only Gain components loaded

3. Test different filter patterns:
   - Try filter: "^Audio" (components starting with Audio)
   - Try filter: "Mixer|Matrix" (components with Mixer OR Matrix)
   - Try filter: ".*_1$" (components ending with _1)

4. Verify filtered discovery:
   - Use qsys_discover with no params
   - Should only show filtered components
   - Use qsys_get on filtered components - should work
   - Use qsys_get on non-filtered component - should error

5. Performance comparison:
   - Compare connection time with/without filter
   - Check memory usage difference
   - Verify faster connection with filtered subset

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Baseline Components: [e.g., 97 total]
- Filtered Components: [e.g., 5 Gain components]
- Filter Applied: [true]
- Memory Savings: [percentage reduced]
- Connection Speed: [faster with filter]
- Pattern Tests: [all regex patterns work]

NOTE: Filtering is ideal for large Q-SYS designs to reduce memory
```

### Test 0.3: Auto-Reconnection Capability

```
TEST: Auto-Reconnection Testing

Test the MCP3.0 auto-reconnection with exponential backoff:

1. Verify connected with qsys_status
2. Note current uptime and reconnectAttempt counter
3. Ask user: "To test auto-reconnection, temporarily disconnect network or power cycle Q-SYS Core. Type 'done' when disconnected:"
4. Once user confirms:
   - Check qsys_status - should show disconnected or reconnecting
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Check status again - should show reconnectAttempt incrementing
5. Ask user: "Restore network/power. Type 'done' when restored:"
6. Monitor reconnection:
   - Check status every 2 seconds
   - Note when connection restored
   - Verify reconnectAttempt resets to 0

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Initial State: [connected, uptime]
- Disconnect Detected: [yes/no]
- Reconnect Attempts: [count observed]
- Reconnection Time: [seconds]
- Final State: [connected, new uptime]
- Exponential Backoff: [delays observed: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s]

NOTE: MCP3.0 implements automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

```

### Test 4.3: Batch Set Operations with Validation (5 Scenarios)

```
TEST 4.3: Control Value Setting with Type Safety

PREREQUISITE STEPS:
1. Use qsys_discover with includeControls: true
2. Identify controls by type:
   - Float controls (Type: "Float") - usually gains, levels
   - Boolean controls (Type: "Boolean") - usually mutes, enables
   - Integer controls (Type: "Integer") - if available
3. Note their paths and current values

Execute these 5 batch set scenarios IN ORDER:

1. Simple Set with Type Validation:
   - Find one Float control (e.g., gain)
   - Find one Boolean control (e.g., mute)
   - Use qsys_set with controls:
     [{path: float_path, value: -10.5},
      {path: bool_path, value: true}]
   - Both should return confirmed: true
   - Try setting Boolean with number:
     [{path: bool_path, value: 1}]
   - Should get type error: "Boolean control requires true/false"

2. Batch Set (10 controls):
   - Create array of 10 control updates
   - Mix Float and Boolean types with valid values
   - Use qsys_set with controls: [array_of_10]
   - Response should have 10 objects
   - Each should have confirmed: true
   - All should complete together (parallel)

3. Range Validation:
   - Use a gain control (typically min: -100, max: 20)
   - First get the control to see actual min/max
   - Try qsys_set with value: -200 (below min)
   - Error should state: "Value -200 below minimum -100"
   - Try qsys_set with value: 50 (above max)
   - Error should state: "Value 50 above maximum 20"
   - Try qsys_set with value: 0 (valid)
   - Should succeed with confirmed: true

4. Protected Control Testing:
   - Look for control starting with "Master." or "Emergency."
   - If none exist, try "SystemMute" or any ".power" control
   - First attempt without force:
     [{path: protected_path, value: any_value}]
   - Should get error: "Protected control. Use force:true to override"
   - Retry with force:
     [{path: protected_path, value: any_value, force: true}]
   - Should succeed with confirmed: true
   - If no protected controls, note "No protected controls found"

5. Maximum Batch (50 controls):
   - Create array of exactly 50 control updates
   - Use any available control paths
   - Set all to safe values (0 for gains, false for mutes)
   - Use qsys_set with controls: [array_of_50]
   - This is the maximum allowed per call
   - All 50 should return with confirmed: true
   - Or error if control is read-only

REPORT FORMAT:
- Scenario 1: Type Validation = [Float works, Boolean works, type error caught]
- Scenario 2: Batch 10 = [10 confirmed updates]
- Scenario 3: Range Check = [min: X, max: Y, validation works]
- Scenario 4: Protection = [blocked without force, succeeded with force]
- Scenario 5: Batch 50 = [50 updates processed, max limit works]
- Overall Result: [PASS if validation and batching work]
```

### Test 4.4: Error Messages and Recovery (5 Scenarios)

```
TEST 3.3: Helpful Error Messages

Execute these 5 error message scenarios:

1. Invalid Component Name:
   - Use qsys_get with path "FakeComponent.control"
   - Verify error suggests available components

2. Invalid Control Name:
   - Use valid component but fake control name
   - Verify error suggests available controls for that component

3. Malformed Path:
   - Use qsys_get with path "NoDotsHere"
   - Verify clear error about path format

4. Type Mismatch:
   - Try setting Boolean control with number
   - Try setting Float control with string
   - Verify specific type error messages

5. Batch Partial Failure:
   - Set 5 controls where 2 will fail
   - Verify successful ones complete
   - Verify failed ones have clear errors

REPORT FORMAT:
- Scenario 1: Bad Component = [suggests alternatives]
- Scenario 2: Bad Control = [suggests valid controls]
- Scenario 3: Bad Format = [explains format requirement]
- Scenario 4: Type Errors = [specific and helpful]
- Scenario 5: Partial Batch = [3 succeed, 2 fail with reasons]

```

### Test 5.3: Parallel Operation Testing (5 Scenarios)

```
TEST 5.3: Parallel Batch Performance

PREREQUISITE STEPS:
1. Use qsys_discover to collect 100+ control paths
2. Prepare arrays of different sizes for testing

Execute these 5 parallel operation tests IN ORDER:

1. Sequential vs Batch Comparison:
   - Pick 20 control paths
   - Sequential: Call qsys_get 20 times, each with 1 control
     * controls: [path1], then controls: [path2], etc.
   - Batch: Call qsys_get once with all 20
     * controls: [path1, path2, ... path20]
   - Both should work, batch returns all 20 at once
   - Note: Batch is more efficient (1 round trip vs 20)

2. Parallel Set Operations:
   - Create 30 control updates
   - Use qsys_set with controls: [array of 30 updates]
   - Response should have 30 objects
   - All should have confirmed: true (or error if read-only)

```
TEST 6.1: System Limits with Enhanced Features

PREREQUISITE STEPS:
1. Use qsys_connect with host: "192.168.50.150"
2. Use qsys_discover to get available components

Execute these 5 boundary tests IN ORDER:

1. Monitor Limits:
   - Try empty array: qsys_monitor with:
     * action: "start", id: "empty_test", controls: []
   - Should either error or start with monitoring: 0
   - Try 200 controls (create large array):
     * action: "start", id: "large_test", controls: [200 paths]
   - Should handle gracefully (may limit or accept all)
   - Try duplicate ID while "large_test" still active:
     * action: "start", id: "large_test", controls: [any path]
   - May error or replace existing monitor
   - Stop any started monitors

2. Filter Pattern Limits:
   - Try invalid regex: qsys_connect with:
     * host: "192.168.50.150", filter: "[invalid(regex"
   - Should error with "Invalid filter pattern"
   - Try filter matching nothing:
     * host: "192.168.50.150", filter: "^NoSuchComponent$"
   - Should error "No components match filter"
   - Try filter matching everything:
     * host: "192.168.50.150", filter: ".*"
   - Should connect with all components
   - Try complex pattern:
     * host: "192.168.50.150", filter: "(Gain|Matrix).*[0-9]+$"
   - Should work if valid regex

3. Metadata Edge Cases:
   - Use qsys_get on various controls
   - Look for controls where:
     * min/max are undefined (common for non-numeric)
     * choices is empty array or undefined
     * direction might be missing
   - All should return without crashing
   - Missing fields should be undefined or appropriate defaults

4. Monitor ID Validation:
   - Try special characters:
     * action: "start", id: "test!@#$%", controls: [path]
   - Try very long ID (create 150 character string):
     * action: "start", id: "x" repeated 150 times, controls: [path]
   - Try numeric only:
     * action: "start", id: "12345", controls: [path]
   - Try empty string:
     * action: "start", id: "", controls: [path]
   - Each should either work or give clear error
   - Stop any successful monitors

5. Combined Feature Limits:
   - Connect with strict filter:
     * qsys_connect host: "192.168.50.150", filter: "^Gain"
   - Use qsys_discover to see filtered components
   - Start monitor on filtered component:
     * action: "start", id: "filtered", controls: ["Gain_1.gain"]
   - Try to monitor non-filtered component:
     * action: "start", id: "outside", controls: ["Matrix_1.crosspoint"]
   - Should fail since Matrix not in filtered set
   - Error should mention component not found

REPORT FORMAT:
- Scenario 1: Monitor Limits = [empty: X, 200: Y, duplicate: Z]
- Scenario 2: Filter Patterns = [invalid: error, empty: error, all: works]
- Scenario 3: Missing Metadata = [handled gracefully, no crashes]
- Scenario 4: Monitor IDs = [special: X, long: Y, numeric: Z, empty: W]
- Scenario 5: Filter+Monitor = [filtered works, outside filter fails]
- Overall Result: [PASS if no crashes]

4. Long Control Names:
   - Most Q-SYS controls have reasonable names
   - Try a very long fake path:
     * "VeryLongComponentName1234567890.VeryLongControlName1234567890"
   - Use qsys_get with this path
   - Should error gracefully
   - Error message should be readable (not overflow)

5. Special Characters in Paths:
   - Q-SYS typically uses: letters, numbers, spaces, underscores
   - Try these paths in qsys_get:

     * "Component 1.control name" (spaces - may work)
     * "Component-1.control-name" (hyphens - may work)
     * "Component.control.extra.dots" (extra dots - should fail)
   - Valid characters should parse correctly
   - Invalid should give format error

REPORT FORMAT:
- Scenario 1: Polling Limits = [33 clamped to 34, 34 accepted]
- Scenario 2: Empty Batches = [both error with minItems message]

## TEST EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### For Test Operators:

1. **Always start with Test 0.1** (Connection Verification)
2. **Copy entire test blocks** including expected output format
3. **Provide actual Q-SYS Core IP** when prompted
4. **Document exact timings** for performance tests
5. **Save complete results** for analysis

### Expected Testing Time:

- Quick Validation (Tests 0.1, 1.1, 2.1, 3.1): ~5 minutes
- Standard Validation (All sections except 7): ~15 minutes  
- Comprehensive Validation (All sections): ~20 minutes

### Success Criteria:

- **PASS**: Meets all performance targets and functional requirements
- **FAIL**: Misses performance targets or functional errors
- **PARTIAL**: Works but with performance below target

### Critical Success Metrics:

- All 5 tools must be accessible and functional
- Connection time must be < 1 second
- Tool overhead must be < 10ms
- Memory usage must stay < 50MB
- Auto-reconnection must work
- Batch operations must be parallel

## QUICK REFERENCE: MCP3.0 TOOLS

1. **qsys_connect** - Connect to Q-SYS Core with configuration options
   - NEW: `filter` parameter for component filtering (regex)
2. **qsys_discover** - Discover components and controls with caching
   - NEW: Returns `direction`, `choices`, `min`, `max` fields
3. **qsys_get** - Get control values in parallel batches (max 100)
   - NEW: Includes `direction`, `choices`, `min`, `max` in response
4. **qsys_set** - Set control values with validation (max 50)
5. **qsys_status** - Get connection status and system information
6. **qsys_monitor** - NEW: Real-time control monitoring
   - Actions: start, read, stop
   - Circular buffer of 100 events
   - Multiple independent monitors

## KEY DIFFERENCES FROM V1

- **Reduced from 18 to 6 tools** - Direct SDK pass-through pattern
- **No change groups** - Removed for simplicity
- **NEW: Real-time monitoring** - Via qsys_monitor tool
- **NEW: Component filtering** - Reduce memory usage
- **NEW: Enhanced metadata** - direction, choices, min/max fields
- **No API documentation tool** - Removed as unnecessary
- **Single connection action** - Instead of 11 separate actions
- **1-second discovery cache** - For performance optimization
- **Strict batch limits** - 100 for get, 50 for set
- **Protected control patterns** - Built-in safety

---

## NOTES

- Test results should be reported immediately after each test
- Performance metrics must include actual times in milliseconds
- Memory usage should be monitored throughout testing
- All batch operations should verify parallel execution
- Connection issues should be resolved before continuing tests
